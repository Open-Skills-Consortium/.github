# Who We Are
The Open Skills Consortium is a global nonprofit coalition uniting HR leaders, educators, policymakers, and technologists to build an open, interoperable framework for skills and competencies. Inspired by the Open Geospatial Consortium’s success with geodata standards, we’re pioneering a “Bologna Process for skills” - so credentials, micro-credentials, resumes, and job requirements speak a shared, machine‑readable language worldwide.

# What We Do
- Define open skill taxonomies and data schemas, enabling consistent interpretation across systems.
- Publish reference APIs and open-source tools to facilitate seamless adoption by HR software, LMS platforms, and credentialing services.
- Pilot real-world use cases—from skills-based hiring and upskilling programmes to digital credential verification.
- Facilitate multi-sector collaboration, assembling working groups and events to co-create inclusive standards.

# Why It Matters
Skills have become the new global currency, yet inconsistent definitions and siloed data hinder mobility, productivity, and innovation. As the HR Open Standards community emphasizes, unified skills data is essential to enable exchange, interoperability, and transparent talent matching.

# Our framework empowers:
- Employers to adopt data-driven, skills-first hiring and workforce planning
- Educators to align courses and credentials to industry-defined competencies
- Policymakers to address skills mismatches and support economic resilience
- Developers to build next-gen HR/EdTech solutions on a common standard

# Join the Movement
We’re preparing for an official September launch and invite you to:
- HR & Talent Leaders: Innovate with skills-based strategies
- Educators: Ensure learners’ achievements are recognized globally
- Policy Makers: Integrate skills data into workforce planning
